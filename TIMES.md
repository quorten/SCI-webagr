Here is the timeline of relevant event time stamps.  Approximate time
events are marked with "circa."

* 2005-11-20 14:12:15 -0600: Christopher starts creating Spy
  Corp. International's website as a Microsoft Word document.

* circa 2005-11-23 16:00:00 -0600: A few days later, Christopher asks
  about creating a website access agreement program.  Oh, that's easy.
  So I start writing something up starting around 3:00 PM, but then
  about two hours later when it's time for dinner it's still not done
  yet.  Christopher is upset about this, why isn't it like Warcraft
  where they're saying "Work complete" or "Research complete" after
  the time has elapsed?  That's because I wanted to try doing
  something new, so it took longer, but I'm almost done.

* circa 2005-11-23 19:45:00 -0600: Then I finish in the hour after
  dinner.  "There, see?  It's finished, it works, it does what we want
  it to."  Now, I wasn't quite finished yet since there was also
  supposed to be a "spyware downloading" display after you've agreed
  and was continuing to view the website.

* circa 2005-11-24 17:00:00 -0600: Shortly after scrambling just to
  say I have something up and running, I finish it off completely by
  adding "sciup" spyware downloader, complete with the ability to
  restart itself if you try to close it.

* circa 2005-12-02 16:30:00 -0600: Then after several days or so of
  folks playing around with the software, I've received comments that
  the Spy Corp. logo I drawn up looks like a "Dubay" and not like the
  actual Spy Corp. logo.  "How should it look like?" I ask.  It should
  have a triangular boe-tie and the bottom of Spy Fox's head logo
  should be flat, not curved.  Okay, okay, so I make these changes,
  and then all is good.

* 2007-06-08 12:45:19 -0500: "Kill Spy Corp. International Secret
  Weapon!" has been activated, so I made changes to the Spy
  Corp. website access agreement program to disable website access
  with an "access denied" error message.

* 2007-08-30 16:55:46 -0500: Modifications to disabled access, fail
  fast rather than showing the dialog box almost about to work.  This
  makes it easier for users since they don't have to wait so long
  (12.3 seconds) just to see that they don't have access to the
  website.

* 2008-04-05 10:13:44 -0500: Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 Enterprise
  Edition was uninstalled from the home-dell-2300 computer to make way
  for a newer version, Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition,
  which was being installed in progress at this given time.  During
  the uninstall process, I chose to delete the "projects" folder when
  prompted since I felt I didn't have anything important in there
  anymore.  And that's how the original source code got deleted.
